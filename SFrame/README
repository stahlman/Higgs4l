Installation
------------

The first step is to check out the directory containing this file:
>> svn co svn+ssh://svn.cern.ch/reps/penn/stahlman/Higgs4lDev/trunk Higgs4lDev 

This contains all of the packages that I've developed for SFrame.  These depend on the SFrame code itself as well as other ATLAS common utility
packages, so these packages must be checked out before compiling.

SFrame has a Wiki page here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sframe/index.php?title=Main_Page

There is also a Penn Wiki page for this code:
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/SetupHZZ

You can keep track of the latest tag (it is very stable now) here:
http://sframe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sframe/SFrame/

You should check out the latest tag of the code, into the already existing SFrame directory, as well as the additional packages required:

cd Higgs4lDev/SFrame
source checkout_externals.sh

This checks out the SFrame code and also the ATLAS packages in the RootCore directory.  The Rootcore packages are listed in RootCore/my_packages

Before building, you also need to setup Root and Python. The versions used when I built it were SFRAME_VERSION=03-06-22, ROOTCORE_VERSION=00-02-99, ROOT_VERSION=5.34.05 and PYTHON_VERSION=2.6.2.  For AFS mounted machines, I have a script to do this in my public area:

source /afs/cern.ch/user/s/stahlman/public/setupRoot.sh

There is an unfortunate naming collision between SFrame and RooFit which causes some errors.  The SFrame author knows of this error, but a fix has not been implemented yet to my knowledge.  I've had to modify a few of the SFrame files in order to make it compile properly. Those modified files and the locations to which they should be copied are in Higgs4lDev/SFrame/ModifiedSFrameFiles. Look at the README for instructions.


You need to source the SFrame setup script (from the correct directory!), then the Makefile from my SFrame directory should just build everything:

cd SFrame
source setup.sh
cd ../RootCore
source rootcore_build.sh
cd ..
make

Now that you've made SFrame, the only thing you need to do every time you want
to use it is setup Root and source SFrame/setup.sh. Or, you can use the setup script in the top level directory Higgs4lDev/setup.sh which needs to 
be modified for your local install

Running
-------

To run a job, the commands take the following form:

sframe_main <config_file.xml>

To run the cutflow on some example ntuples saved on pc-penn-d-01, do:

sframe_main ZZSelection/config/ZZCutflow_test_mc_config.xml
